# papajadown

This is a template and minimal example for using papaja and pkgdown to share the results of a research project on the web. papaja is used to write an APA style manuscript. pkgdown is used to create a website from an R package. Putting the two together let's you share the APA paper in the form of a pkgdown website. This has the added benefit of being able to share the whole project as an R package, along with data (and pretty documentation for the data), and any custom functions used for analysis.

The source files are located in this github repository [https://github.com/CrumpLab/papajadown](https://github.com/CrumpLab/papajadown)

Note: this example is in development, but the basics seem to work.
